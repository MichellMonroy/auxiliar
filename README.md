Simulation of path of an especific comet in C and MPI

Generally speaking, a comet is a celestial body composed mainly of solid matter like ice with organic resting material, dust and rocks. They can have elliptical, parabolic, or hyperbolic orbits, but the most common in the solar system are the elliptical orbits.

The study of the trajectories of a comet date back to the 16th century, when Edmund Halley tried to calculate the trajectory of the comet that would later carry his lastname, using Newton's theory of gravitation as support. In this experiment he discovered that this orbit had a periodic behavior of 76, 77 years. Later in 1821, the German mathematician Johann Encke discovered another comet whose orbit was also periodic, with a period of 3.3 years

I will focus on calculating the path of a specific comet, in this case, Halley Comet which is considered a young comet (P-AGE <30) and dwarf comet <1.5 km of diameter. The coordinate system will have the sun at the origin, that means, heliocentric coordinates will be used to calculate the orbit. As an ephemeris for this comet I will use the following date 03/15/1998.
